    <ul>
        <li>Crop Yield production[ 15 Jul 2024 – 14 Nov 2024 ]
            <p>
                Developed a machine learning model to accurately predict crop yields using
                environmental and soil data. Conducted data preprocessing, implemented models like
                Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor, and evaluated performance with metrics
                like R² Score. Created interactive visualizations to support sustainable agricultural
                planning and align with UN SDG 2: Zero Hunger
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Bank Loan Prediction[ 18 Jun 2024 – 15 Nov 2024 ]
            <p>
                Developed a predictive system using machine learning algorithms to determine the
                eligibility of loan approvals based on user input data. The system incorporates a userfriendly
                interface with secure registration and login functionalities, including unique
                account ID and password creation. It collects essential details such as phone number,
                email ID, address, pincode, and proof of identity (Aadhar card, PAN card, and other
                government-approved documents). The project also supports multilingual capabilities to
                enhance user accessibility. The system aims to improve decision making efficiency for
                financial institutions and ensure a seamless user experience
